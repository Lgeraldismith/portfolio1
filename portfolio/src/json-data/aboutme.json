  "description": "I am a second-year Biomedical Engineering student at the University of Florida, with a strong interest in biomedical data science and computer applications. I work as an undergraduate research assistant annotator with the Intelligent Health Lab, where I help train and develop a large neural network for predictive analysis of ICU delirium. I am highly motivated and a quick learner, and I hope to leverage these traits along with my data annotation and MATLAB skills to pursue a career in biomedical data science. I am also the Newsletter Director at the UF Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers, I update and automate the biweekly SHPEUF Newsletter to keep members updated and informed regarding industry opportunities and upcoming events. I use my programming and database management skills to create and maintain a user-friendly and engaging newsletter platform."
